## Nelson Kiyoshi Kossuga

I am a programmer with great interest in computer geometry, shaders, openGL and other graphics-related topics.

I have 3+ years of experience with Unity-C# and HLSL. [Here](https://github.com/5Daydreams/SnakeGameAlgorithms) is a game project I tinkered with during my time in Futuregames, and [here](https://github.com/5Daydreams/ProceduralGeometryUnity) are some of my studies on Procedural Geometry with Unity.

These are some of the shaders I worked on with Unity:

I have also been studying a lot about rendering with openGL on my free time. [This](https://github.com/5Daydreams/StudiesOpenGL) is what I am currently experimenting with.

As a hobby, I also like to make animations with procedural art, here are some of the things I made with Processing:
