## About me

I am a programmer with a deep interest in computer geometry, shader coding, openGL and other graphics-related topics. 

I worked for a little over a year in Double Dash Studios, from Rio de Janeiro - I developed my understanding of programming at a fast pace during my days there thanks to the great training and mentorships with my coworkers. I later enrolled into Futuregames (FG 21 autumn) and I am planning to graduate by 2023. 

With my prior experience I can safely work with Agile/Scrum teams, I also have 3+ years of experience with Unity-C#, around 2 years of HLSL, around 1 year worth of C++ but I am rapidly learning more thanks to my studies on openGL, which I started around march of this year (2022).


## Shaders made in Unity's Legacy Pipeline:

A study on volumetric rendering of primitive shapes with raymarching:

A "swirl" animation for uv's, with customizable swirlyness:

A dance floor with flashing lights - the assets are from my Game Project 1 during Futuregames, and during the gameplay, the color of the lights indicated if you hit the dance move on the correct beat or not:

Vertex shading - I was moving a handle to get this wave effect:

## Studies on low-level rendering with openGL and c++

I have also been studying a lot about rendering with openGL on my free time. [This](https://github.com/5Daydreams/StudiesOpenGL) is what I am currently experimenting with.

## Unity projects

[Here](https://github.com/5Daydreams/SnakeGameAlgorithms) is a game project I tinkered with during my time in Futuregames.

And [here](https://github.com/5Daydreams/ProceduralGeometryUnity) are some of my studies on Procedural Geometry with Unity.

## Miscellaneous

As a hobby, I also like to make animations with procedural art, here are some of the things I made with Processing:
