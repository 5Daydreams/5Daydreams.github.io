## Nelson Kiyoshi Kossuga

I am a programmer with interest in computer geometry, shaders, openGL and GPU-related topics.

I have 3+ years of experience with Unity C# and HLSL. [Here is one of my solo projects](https://github.com/5Daydreams/SnakeGameAlgorithms), it is a snake game in 3D with flight movement.

I have also been studying a lot about rendering with GPU and rendering by primitives and shaders on my free time. This is what I am currently experimenting with: [fancy.link](https://github.com/5Daydreams/StudiesOpenGL)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/5Daydreams/5Daydreams.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
