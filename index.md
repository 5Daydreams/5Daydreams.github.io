## About me

I am a programmer with a deep interest in computer geometry, shader coding, openGL and other graphics-related topics. 

I worked for a little over a year in Double Dash Studios, an indie studio from Rio de Janeiro - I improved my understanding of programming at a fast pace during my days there thanks to the great training and tutoring from my coworkers. I later enrolled into Futuregames (FG 21 fall-term) and I will be graduating in the spring of 2023.

With my prior experience I can comfortably work with Agile/Scrum teams, I also know how to work with git GUI's, including using gitflow for branching and merging - but I am by far not a master in version control.

I have 3+ years of experience with Unity-C# - both 2D and 3D, as well as 2 years of shaderlab experience, both within shadergraph and HLSL - while I am more used to the legacy render pipeline, I can work just as comfortably with URP. I have worked on procedural mesh generation and in basic development tools with Unity-C#, such as object placement and custom inspector windows. I usually connect my scripts through event-driven architectures for their simplicity and flexibility in Unity's editor.

I have around 1 year of C++ experience, which recently became my main language and the one I'm using to study openGL, a journey which I started around march of 2022. I aim to have a simple 3D game which runs with my graphics library before the end of this year (2022).

I have also worked with Unreal Engine (both UE 4 and 5) for little less than a year, using both the Material Editor's shader nodes and Niagara Systems for technical art assets, with the support of the Blueprint System. I currently consider myself slower at handling C++ code made for Unreal due to my inexperience with the engine's features - but I can also produce C++ code.


## Shaders made in Unity's Legacy Pipeline:

This was a study on volumetric rendering of primitive shapes with raymarching:

Here are some Stencil-Buffer Effects:

This was a "swirl" animation for uv's, the idea was to have this behind the glass of washing machines. 
This effect was made in HLSL with some uv-remapping in fragment shader:

A disco dance floor with flashing lights. 
The pixel-art assets were produced by my artist teammates for a two-week game project during my time in Futuregames. 
During gameplay, the color of the dancefloor's lights indicated if you hit the dance move on the correct beat or not:

During my early experiments with Vertex shading I was able to get this wave effect by moving a handle:

## Studies on low-level rendering with openGL and c++

[This](https://github.com/5Daydreams/StudiesOpenGL) is what I am currently experimenting with my rendering and openGL studies.

## Unity projects

[Here](https://github.com/5Daydreams/SnakeGameAlgorithms) is a solo project I tinkered with during my time in Futuregames - it is a 3D snake game with flying movement, the objective being to survive as long as possible while avoiding the ever increasing asteroids in a closed arena.

[Here](https://github.com/5Daydreams/ProceduralGeometryUnity) are some of my studies on Procedural Geometry with Unity. 
I really enjoy working on these objects, but I have never used them in my games. I really appreciate how closely related this type of code is to graphics programming "from scratch", but it is usually an overly complicated method to getting symmetrical art assets.

[This](https://github.com/5Daydreams/SudokuSolver) was a really fun research project I did to try and understand how the Wave-Function-Collapse Algorithm works. I ended up very satisfied with just being able to generate the Sudoku boards, and couldn't find a more creative use for my implementation of the algorithm.

[And this was a project from back in 2021](https://github.com/5Daydreams/GridMaze) where I was studying procedural generation for mazes. At the time I was relatively inexperienced, but this was one of the first games I managed to work on from start to finish.


## Miscellaneous

[Here are some of the things I made with Processing](https://github.com/5Daydreams/processing-procedural):
As a hobby, I also like to make some simple generative art, I believe this is a great exercise for computer-mathematics, and is how I got started with programming. It is also very fun to prototype movement scripts and custom physics equations!
